# Overview

In this project I am trying to develop an ATM Banking System, which will allow users to create new accounts, to view their account information, to deposit and withdraw.

This software will be divided in three different files. One file will be the header, where the classes and variables will be. Another file will be the one that will pull the proper variables from the account constructor in the header file. Finally, the main file where all the functions will be called to execute the program.

The purpose of writing this code is to get to know the C++ language better, explore my skills, and face problems along the way in order to solve them.

# Development Environment

I use many tools to develop this project, internet sources, youtube videos, talking to other people to understand the concepts, and a lot of practice.


# Useful Websites

Some of the useful websites I have used are as follows:
* [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/)
* [cplusplus](https://cplusplus.com/reference/stl/)

# Future Work

Some of the things I would like to implement in the future are:
* Display a screen where the user can view the options 
* Create an option to close an account
