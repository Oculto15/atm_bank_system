# Overview

In this project I am trying to develop an ATM Bank System, which will allow users to create new accounts, to see their information account, options to deposit and withdraw.

This software will be divided in three different files. One file will be the header, where the clases and variables will be. Another file will be the one that pull the proper variables from the account constuctor in the header file. Lastly, the main file where all function will be call to run the program

The porpuse of writing this code is to get a better knowlegde of C++ language, explore my habilities, and face problem n the way to be able to solve them.
